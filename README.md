# Titanic-Passenger-Survived

The purpose of this project is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Description

In this project, I have used **naive bayes classifier** to predict which passengers survived.

## Dataset Information
The data has been split into two groups:

- training set (train.csv)
- test set (test.csv)

pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
- 1st = Upper
- 2nd = Middle
- 3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5 <br>

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br>
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister<br>
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)<br>

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br>
Parent = mother, father<br>
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson<br>
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
